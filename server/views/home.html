    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Check the controls for exporting your waste</h1>

    <p>You can use this service to find out what controls apply to exporting your waste from England, Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland to the country it’s destined for.</p>

    <p><strong>You should not use this service to classify your waste. It is your responsibility to classify your waste correctly. Further information on waste classification is available <a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-classify-different-types-of-waste" class="govuk-link">here:</a></strong></p>

    <p>This service only covers the waste types listed in <strong>Annexes III and IV</strong> of the <strong><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32006R1013" class="govuk-link">Waste Shipments Regulation</a></strong>. There are many wastes not included in these Regulations. If you cannot find the waste you want to export you must describe it as ‘not listed’ and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-and-exporting-waste#notification-controls-how-to-comply" class="govuk-link">notification controls will apply</a>.</p>

    <p>Please read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-and-exporting-waste" class="govuk-link">our guidance webpage</a> for full information about waste shipments.<p>
